Jenkins is a leading open source automation server, it provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

As an organization matures from a continuous delivery standpoint, its building-deploying and automating requirements will similarly grow. 
Jenkins supports the "master/agent" mode, to support distributed build environment, where the workload of building projects are delegated to multiple agents.

This repository contains docker image of a Jenkins agent, which can be used in a distributed build architecture.

An agent is a machine set up to offload projects from the master. The method with which builds are scheduled depends on the configuration given to each project. For example, some projects may be configured to "restrict where this project is run" which ties the project to a specific agent or set of labeled agents. Other projects which omit this configuration will select an agent from the available pool in Jenkins.
